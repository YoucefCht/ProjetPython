Introduce 
This project uses the TF-IDF (Term Inverse Frequency) technique to analyze text and extract important information about the words used. 
Featured: 

- 1. Extract names of presidents 
The file `functions.py`  contains the function `president_name`  which extracts the names of presidents from filenames in a specified directory.

The “copy” function in “functions.py” copies files from one directory to another, converting  text to lower case.  - 3. Delete punctuation 
The “punctuation” function in “functions.py” will remove punctuation from text files in a directory. 
 - 4. Calculate TF, IDF and TF-IDF  
The `main.py` file uses the `Matrix` function to calculate TF, IDF, and TF-IDF scores for words contained in files in a specified directory. 
 - 5. Shows the words with the highest TF-IDF score 
The function `display_highest_tfidf`  in `functions.py` displays the word(s) with the highest TF-IDF score. 
 - 6. Merge values ​​from two files 
The function `merge_values`  in `functions.py` merges the values ​​of words in two files and writes the sum to an output file.
